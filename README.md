## Usage

Webpage for checking the weather in a given location.

Type your location into the search bar, and hey presto, guess what, you'll get the weather for that area. In the olden days, this would be considered magic. What a world we live in.

If you open up the console, there is also the 5 day forcast, but I could not get it to display.
